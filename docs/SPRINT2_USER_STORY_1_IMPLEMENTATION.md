CREATE TABLE goals (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    category VARCHAR(50),
    difficulty_level goal_difficulty DEFAULT 'medium',
    target_completion_date DATE,
    is_completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    completion_date TIMESTAMP,
    progress_percentage INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    points_reward INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    is_public BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### 2. API Testing (Manual)

Test the backend endpoints directly:

```bash
# Create a goal
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/goals \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Learn React Hooks",
    "description": "Master useState, useEffect, and custom hooks",
    "category": "Web Development",
    "difficulty_level": "medium",
    "target_completion_date": "2025-12-31",
    "is_public": false
  }'

# Get all goals
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:3001/api/goals
```

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Validation Strategy
- **Client-side**: Zod schema with React Hook Form for immediate user feedback
- **Server-side**: Zod schema in controller for security and data integrity
- **Database**: PostgreSQL constraints as final safety net

### 2. State Management
- **Local State**: React useState for component-level state
- **Authentication**: AuthContext for user session management
- **API State**: Direct service calls with error handling

### 3. UI/UX Design
- **Design System**: Tailwind CSS for consistent styling
- **Components**: Modular components for reusability
- **Responsiveness**: Mobile-first responsive design
- **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML and keyboard navigation

### 4. Error Handling
- **Network Errors**: Axios interceptors with user-friendly messages
- **Validation Errors**: Field-level error display
- **Authentication Errors**: Automatic redirect to login
- **Server Errors**: Toast notifications for user feedback

## Security Considerations

### 1. Authentication
- JWT tokens in localStorage with automatic cleanup
- Protected routes with auth middleware
- User ownership validation for all goal operations

### 2. Input Validation
- Client and server-side validation with Zod
- SQL injection prevention with parameterized queries
- XSS prevention with proper input sanitization

### 3. Authorization
- User-specific goal access only
- Public/private goal visibility controls
- Secure API endpoints with auth middleware

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Frontend
- Lazy loading of goal components
- Efficient re-rendering with proper key usage
- Optimized API calls with error boundaries

### 2. Backend
- Database indexing on user_id and created_at
- Efficient SQL queries with proper JOINs
- Response caching for static data

### 3. Database
- Connection pooling for concurrent users
- Optimized queries with proper indexing
- Foreign key constraints for data integrity

## Future Enhancements (Next User Stories)

### 1. Goal Editing
- Inline editing for goal properties
- Drag-and-drop priority reordering
- Bulk operations for multiple goals

### 2. Progress Tracking
- Progress update modal with percentage slider
- Milestone creation and tracking
- Progress history and analytics

### 3. Social Features
- Public goal discovery page
- Goal sharing and collaboration
- Peer progress tracking

### 4. Gamification
- Achievement system integration
- Point leaderboards
- Progress badges and rewards

## Deployment Notes

### 1. Environment Variables
Ensure proper environment configuration:
```bash
# Backend
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/skillwise
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
NODE_ENV=production

# Frontend  
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

### 2. Database Migrations
Run the goals migration before deployment:
```bash
npm run migrate
```

### 3. Docker Configuration
The implementation works with existing Docker setup:
- No additional containers required
- Uses existing PostgreSQL database
- Integrated with current development workflow
